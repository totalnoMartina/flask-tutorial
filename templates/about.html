<h2>About Page</h2>
<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
    Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
    Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
    Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
    action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
    leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
            Mountain.
            Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug
            in TA
            2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
            participated in the
            Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria.
            At some
            point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he
            gained
            the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews
            of
            Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose,
            the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

        <h3>Óin</h3>
        <p>He succeeded his father as king in TA 2385. He was also an ancestor to Balin the friend of Bilbo Baggins and
            Gimli the Elf-friend.
            Óin's reign was largely uneventful while he and his people lived in the Grey Mountains. In the final years
            of his reign, Sauron
            returned to Dol Guldur in Mirkwood and his shadow spread. As well, the Orcs of the Misty Mountains
            multiplied, plundering Moria
            and occupying it for hundreds of years.
            Óin died in TA 2488 after a rule of one-hundred and three years and was succeeded by his son Náin II.

        <h3>Gloin</h3>
        <p>Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and
            younger brother of Óin.

            In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the
            Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.

            In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In
            March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to
            reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them
            as "simpletons" and also said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the
            nakedest dragonet new from the shell".

        <h3>Balin</h3>
        <p>Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves
            who accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
            A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest friends
            and advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of Durin.

            He later went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in Moria, but within five years it was overcome once more
            by Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.

        <h3>Dwalin</h3>
        <p>Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and
            younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied
            Thráin II and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

            Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left the
            Ered Luin on a Quest to reclaim Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845,
            Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black
            rain. After a fruitless search for their king, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the
            news.

        <h3>Ori</h3>
        <p>Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a
            member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other Dwarves on the
            quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other Dwarves of
            Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies, which he survived.

        <h3>Dori</h3>
        <p>Dori was a Dwarf of Durin's Folk, who, along with his brother Nori and cousin Ori,[1] travelled with Bilbo
            Baggins and Thorin Oakenshield as a member of Thorin's Company on the Quest for Erebor, to reclaim the
            Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.

            Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End who joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the
            forks"; as well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent fellow despite his
            grumbling”. He often wore a red-violet coat while on the Quest for Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be the
            strongest of the thirteen companions.

            remote kinsman
            of Thorin Oakenshield. His hood was purple, he played the flute, and he was very fond of regular and
            plentiful meals
            like his Hobbit friend, Bilbo Baggins.

        <h3>Bifur</h3>
        <p>Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not related to the royal House of Durin.
            Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his
            family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in
            exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life at his
            halls in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

        <p>Bofur was a Dwarf of the late-Third Age. He is best known as a companion of Bilbo Baggins, Thorin
            Oakenshield, and Gandalf on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, along with his
            brother Bombur and cousin Bifur.

        <h3>Bombur</h3>
        <p>Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's
            line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown, though it fell
            somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some
            fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and
            Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey,
            Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

        <p>Gandalf the Grey, later known as Gandalf the White, and originally named Olórin (Quenya; IPA: [oˈloːrin]),
            was an Istar (Wizard), dispatched to Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined
            Thorin II Oakenshield and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, helped form the Fellowship
            of the Ring to destroy the One Ring, and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War of the Ring.
